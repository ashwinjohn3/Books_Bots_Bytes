We encourage lively debate, passionate discussion, intellectual curiosity, and respectful interactions from all of our group members,



In January 2014, Stanford University professors Trevor Hastie and Rob
Tibshirani (authors of the legendary [Elements of Statistical Learning]
textbook) taught an [online course] based on their newest textbook,
**[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R]
(ISLR)**. I found it to be an excellent course in statistical learning
(also known as \"machine learning\"), largely due to the high quality of
both the textbook and the video lectures. And as an R user, it was
extremely helpful that they included R code to demonstrate most of the
techniques described in the book.

**If you are new to machine learning (and even if you are not an R
user), I highly recommend reading ISLR from cover-to-cover** to gain
both a theoretical and practical understanding of many important methods
for regression and classification. It is available as a [free PDF
download][An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R]
from the authors\' website.

If you decide to attempt the exercises at the end of each chapter, there
is a GitHub repository of [solutions provided by students] you can use
to check your work.

**As a supplement to the textbook, you may also want to watch the
excellent course lecture videos** (linked below), in which Dr. Hastie
and Dr. Tibshirani discuss much of the material. In case you want to
browse the lecture content, I\'ve also linked to the PDF slides used in
the videos.
